  title: "Cardinals are defined in terms of Ordinals"
  ref: "p167, p197"
  note: "There is no simple way to define cardinals rigorously, while keeping the properties we need axiomatically. This requires first ascending towards a definition of ordinals, while passing partial ordering, and well orderings."

  title: "Well-Ordering Theorem"
  conditions:
    - "A is a set"
    - "Axiom of Choice"
  right: "exists a well-ordering on A"

  conditions: "A is a set"

relation:
  left: well-ordering-thm
  right: hartogs-theorem
  description: "Hartog's theorem is like a weak version of the well-ordering theorem, where the axiom of choice is not assumed."
axiomatic.cardinality:
    right:
      - equinumeousity-compatible: "card A = card B iff A approx B"
      - finite-number-compatible: "card A = n when A is finite with n elements"
pre-note.transfinite:
  note: "The 'Transfinite Induction Principle', the 'Transfinite Recursion Theorem', 'Transfinite Recursion Theorem Scema' and the 'Replacement Axioms' form a chain of necessary ingerdients to be able to define the ordinals"
pre-note.replacement-axioms:
  note: "These axioms are vaguely similar to the subset axioms, but for function-classes, allowing us to assert that the collection of items nominated by a function-class (with set domain and codomain) is a set"
