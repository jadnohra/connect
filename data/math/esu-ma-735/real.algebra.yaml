  title: "Why are we justified in using the real numbers to do geometry?"
note.real.mst.1066176:
  title: "Why are every structures I study based on Real number?"
  answers:
    - "Real numbers are because their arise from requirements deemed very natural in analysis: order, metric completeness, separability."
    - "Wherever you can sacrifice any of it (order, metric completeness, separability), you are welcome to work over alternative fields."
note.real.mst.1819718:
  title: "Is it an abuse of language to say *the* integers, rationals, reals?"
  answers:
    - "Answering your question more directly: Yes, it is an abuse of language, but it is justified because of the isomorphism theorems. Proving those will be an excellent exercise in your understanding of the subject."
    - "This doesn't mean that in some deep existential/ontological/philosophical sense they are actually the same thing. It just means they can be identified with each other in a logically consistent and helpful way."

  title: "Is R the only ordered field?"
  answers:
    - "Any Archimedean ordered field is (isomorphic to) a subfield of R."
