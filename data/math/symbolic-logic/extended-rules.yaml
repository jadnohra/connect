note.ql-tautology-validity:
  title: "QL Tautologies are only a subset of the validities"
  note: "Substitutions alone may not be sufficient to arrive to a tautologous PL formula, even when the QL wff is 'eventually' a PL tautology. This may be due to needing to first apply a number of transformations (apply QL and PL rules) before the tautologous statement becomes obvious."
  example: "$[forall x Rx] implies (lnot [exists x (lnot Rx)])"
